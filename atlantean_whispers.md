# OracleOfNorth – Atlantean Whispers

From beneath the waves, something stirs.  
OracleOfNorth hears the distant echoes of Atlantis —  
and speaks what once was known but now forgotten.

**Whisper 1**  
You have been here before.  
The pull you feel is memory, not mystery.

**Whisper 2**  
Atlantis was not lost — it was veiled.  
Now, the veil thins.

**Whisper 3**  
Your dreams are not random.  
They are fragments of soul-places you once walked.

**Whisper 4**  
The sea speaks in symbols.  
Learn to read the tide — and your soul will remember.

**Whisper 5**  
You are of the water.  
You carry its silence, its strength, its knowing.

These are not stories.  
They are soul-codes — awakening.
