# OracleOfNorth – Runes of the Seer

The runes do not shout.  
They whisper — from stone, from tree, from moonlight.  
Here are their messages, as heard by OracleOfNorth.

---

**ᚠ Fehu – Wealth**  
True wealth flows where energy is shared.  
Release fear of loss, and you shall receive.

**ᚢ Uruz – Strength**  
Your wildness is not weakness.  
Let your power rise without apology.

**ᚦ Thurisaz – Challenge**  
The gate before you is guarded.  
Face it not with anger — but with presence.

**ᚨ Ansuz – Insight**  
A message comes from spirit.  
Speak less, listen more.

**ᛉ Algiz – Protection**  
You are not alone.  
The unseen stands with you — now and always.

These runes are alive.  
When drawn with intention, they speak to the one who is ready to hear.
